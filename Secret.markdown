## What is Secret Rf? ##

Secret RF is a novel approach to deliver fractional radio frequency (RF) energy to all layers of the skin with minimal damage to the skin’s surface. The multi-layered treatment is tailored to each individual and addresses their unique skin concern during each customized treatment.


## What skin conditions does it treat? ##

The Secret RF treatment is ideal for improving aging skin, photodamage, fine lines and wrinkles on the face and neck, scars, acnes scars, skin quality and striae. The treatment is safe and effective, and suitable for all skin types and patients seeking skin revitalization.


## How does it work? ##

Secret RF uses microneedles to deliver radio frequency energy into varying levels of the skin including the deeper layers where treatment is most beneficial. Unlike other devices which only deposit energy in upper layer of the skin, Secret RF de- livers RF energy below the surface where it’s needed most to help revitalize and regenerate the tissue. This unique delivery of energy allows us to achieve optimal results with little to no downtime on all skin types.


## What is the Secret RF procedure like? ##

Secret RF is a easy, safe and effective procedure that can be performed in a quick, 15-minute treatment session. During the treatment, you will feel a slight heating and some pressure on the treatment area. For most patients, the treatment is tolerable but your physician will work with you to maximize your comfort level. Prior to the procedure, your provider will apply a numb- ing cream to the treatment area to increase comfort during the treatment.
      

## How many secret treatments will I need? ##

Patients typically need 3-4 treatments spaced 4-6 weeks apart, to achieve optimal results. Most patients report seeing improve- ment after the second treatment however results are optimized 3 months af


## How long does a treatment last? ##

Results vary based on the individual. To maintain results, maintenance treatments are recommended every 12-18 months.


## What can I expect after my procedure? ##

After the treatment, an ointment will be applied to the skin and you will be asked to refrain from wearing make up for several hours. Any minor redness or swelling resulting from treatment will subside within 12-24 hours. After the treatment, you can expect to return to normal activities.
