## What is breast lift surgery? ##

Breast lift, technically called mastopexy, is a procedure that raises and firms the breasts by removing excess skin and tightening the surrounding tissue to reshape and support the new breast contour. This is a popular procedure for women who are interested in uplifting their breasts and providing a more youthful appearance. Breast descent can occur following pregnancy or with weight change or also simply with time. This is a common procedure that is easily combined with other cosmetic procedures.


## The Procedure ##

This procedure is done under general anesthesia as an outpatient. There is mild discomfort that usually lasts only a few days. You will be restricted from strenuous activity for about two weeks. Depending upon the type of work you perform you may be back to work in a week or less. The scars from mastopexy surgery can take up to a year to completely settle down and mature. The scar length from breast lift surgery can very considerably. The length of the scar essentially correlates with how much lift is necessary to raise your breast to a more natural position. Small lifts may require only an incision around the areola. Lifting the nipple and areola to a greater degree may require an incision around the areola, straight down from the areola and along the fold under the breast. This is classically described as a ‘anchor’ shaped incision.


## As Dr. Lewis states, ##

“Breast lift surgery is a spectrum of different operations based upon how much an individual patient may require. This procedure can sometimes also be combined with breast augmentation.”
After a mastopexy, the breasts are higher on the chest and firmer to the touch. Breast lifts can also reposition and reduce the size of the areola, which may have stretched or drooped. The change will be evident immediately and results should improve as swelling goes down and the breasts take on a more balanced, natural look.


## What to Expect ##

The goal of breast lift surgery is to reposition the nipple and areola. The volume of the breast also is lifted to a more natural position. It is difficult to entirely predict what will happen to your bra cup size with breast lift surgery. Breast lift surgery should be considered distinct from breast augmentation in outcome. Dr. Lewis will review those differences and also review photographs of patients that have undergone each operation.


## Postprocedure ##

For the first few days after surgery you should plan to rest and only perform light normal activities. You can drive, generally, within the first four to five days after surgery if you a re comfortable off pain medication. You are allowed to shower within 36 hours after surgery. For the most part, all sutures are absorbable and there are no sutures to remove. You will be instructed as time passes after surgery as to how to manage the scars.
