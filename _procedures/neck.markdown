## Procedure Candidates ##

The ideal candidate for neck lift surgery includes physically healthy women and men who have primarily a problem with excess neck skin. Often times that finding is hereditary. This is generally a procedure for younger patients that have preserved upper face (cheek) skin integrity and not much laxity of the facial skin. This procedure is commonly combined with other facial aesthetic surgery such as eyelid surgery. The neck lift is essentially the lower half of a facelift procedure – in simple terms.


## As Dr. Lewis states, ##

“Neck lift surgery can go a long way to returning years to your appearance.”


## Procedure Description ##

Neck lift surgery incisions are commonly placed behind the ears and/or below the chin, allowing the scars to be well hidden. The deeper structures of the neck are tightened. Excess and loose skin is then treated by excision and re-draping of the skin. Excess fat can be removed via liposuction, direct excision, or both, depending on the amount and location. In certain situations, neck lift surgery may also be done in conjunction with chin augmentation for an even more dramatic result.


## What to Expect ##

Neck lift surgery generally takes between one and two hours. The procedure is done under general anesthesia or possibly IV sedation anesthesia in the right patient. This is an outpatient procedure. You will see Dr. Lewis within 24 hours postoperatively for a dressing change and to remove a small drain tube placed at the time of the procedure.


## Preprocedure ##

You will need a ride to and from the surgery center. You should dress comfortably the day of surgery. Prior to surgery you should try and get as much rest as possible. You will visit with Dr. Lewis at least twice before surgery to discuss your desires and expectations.

Questions are always welcome.


## Postprocedure ##

Immediately after the procedure, the neck is fitted with bandages to decrease the recovery time. Bruising may last for seven to 10 days. You should plan to rest with your head elevated for several days after the surgery. You will see Dr. Lewis at his office the first day after surgery. You will have some sutures removed on the fourth or fifth post-op day and some on the eighth or 10 post-op day. You will probably be able to go back to work after seven to 10 days depending upon your progress and the type of work you perform.
