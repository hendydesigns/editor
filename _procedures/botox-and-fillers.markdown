## Procedure Candidates ##

Facial lines and wrinkles occur despite our best efforts. Time, gravity, sun exposure are the primary culprits. Lines and wrinkles can typically be classified as dynamic or static. Dynamic lines occur due to excess muscle activity in the face, known as facial expression lines. Static lines are not necessarily due to excess muscle activity, but are essentially just there from one of the above causes. Botulinum toxin works by temporarily relaxing (weakening) muscles of the face. The most common areas that are treated are frown lines (between the eyebrows), forehead horizontal lines, crows feet lines and a few other not so common areas. Anyone with lines and wrinkles due to excess muscle activity may be considered a candidate for botulinum toxin injection. Botulinum toxin is manufactured under several names such as Botox®, Dysport® and Xeomin®.

Static facial lines and wrinkles are often times treated with injectable fillers. There are several different types of filler materials manufactured under different names. The most common fillers are made of hyaluronic acid. Some common trade names for this material are Juvederm®, Restylane®, Perlane®, and Boletero Balance®. This type of filler can be used to enhance lip volume, treat lines and wrinkles of the face, treat the nasolabial fold lines or any other common area of aging including soft tissue volume loss of the face. Another commonly used filler is call Radiesse®. Radiesse® is calcium hydroxylapatite. Radiesse® is used in the face in a similar fashion to other fillers with a few exceptions.


## As Dr. Lewis states, ##

”Botulinum toxin, Botox® is a perfect, temporary remedy for frown lines. The best part is that it does exactly what it is supposed to do. The worst part is that it wears off.”


## What to Expect ##

The thigh lift procedure is generally performed in two to three hours under general anesthesia as an outpatient.


## Procedure Description ##

Following your consultation with Dr. Lewis specific areas to be treated will be outlined with you. Dr. Lewis performs all injections for his patients personally. The procedure itself takes only a few minutes in the office.


## What to Expect ##

Botox and filler injections are a quick and easy procedure that can take as little as 10-15 minutes. There is some minor discomfort with each injection. Ice is used to mediate the discomfort which is temporary. Following the injection you may have some redness or could possibly have some minor bruising. This is temporary. Botulinum toxin takes a several days to witness the full affect. Again, please see the entire safety and expectation protocols within each particular products website.


## Preprocedure ##

There really are no preprocedure steps to filler injections you must take. When receiving injections, Dr. Lewis recommends you make certain to mention if you’ve had them before and when the most recent treatment was performed. You should also make sure to mention to Dr. Lewis if you are taking aspirin or any other type of blood thinner medication before the procedure.


## Postprocedure ##

There is little or no recovery time from botulinum toxin and filler injections. You can return to work immediately. Botulinum toxin and filler injections are temporary. The duration of effect depends largely on the amount of material used and the locations of the injections. Please refer to the manufacturer website for information regarding duration of effect. Generally, botulinum toxin lasts about three to four months and filler injections can last longer.
