## What is rhinoplasty surgery? ##

Rhinoplasty, or nose surgery, is sometimes referred to as “nose reshaping” or a “nose job”. Nose cosmetic surgery improves the appearance and proportion of your nose, enhancing facial harmony and self-confidence. Nose surgery may also correct impaired breathing caused by structural abnormalities in the nose. While the shape of your nose is usually the result of heredity, the appearance may have been altered in an injury or during prior surgery.


## Rhinoplasty surgery can change: ##

Nose size, in relation to the other facial structures
Nose width, at the bridge
Nose profile, with visible humps or depressions on the bridge
Nasal tip, that is large or bulbous, drooping, or too upturned
Nostrils that are large, wide or upturned
Nasal asymmetry and deviation


## Expectations ##

Rhinoplasty is performed as an outpatient procedure under general anesthesia. Occasionally, minor revisions or changes can be performed under IV sedation anesthesia known as “twilight” anesthesia. One to three hours is normally required to perform the surgery. Most incisions are concealed inside the nose or along its natural creases. Scars from rhinoplasty generally heal favorably with very little noticeability. The majority of contemporary rhinoplasty surgery is performed using the “open” technique. Dr. Lewis commonly performs rhinoplasty using this technique. Occasionally, the “closed” technique can be utilized for minor changes in shape or revision surgery. So-called “closed” rhinoplasty requires only intra nasal incisions. Recent innovations in rhinoplasty include building up the nose to achieve an aesthetically pleasing form (rather than just breaking the bones and removing tissue). Dr. Lewis’ approach is to tailor each procedure to that particular individual’s anatomic concerns. You will meet with Dr. Lewis at least twice before surgery to discuss your concerns and define the approach that will be used for your particular procedure.

Cosmetic rhinoplasty surgery can be combined with “functional” nose surgery also. Patients with functional airway obstruction from septal deviation or nasal airway collapse may be candidates for a combined procedure. Please bring any nasal airway obstructive symptoms to Dr. Lewis’ attention before surgery at your initial consultation. Insurance pre-authorization is required before functional nasal surgery is performed.


## As Dr. Lewis states, ##

“Nose reshaping can produce a dramatic and pleasing improvement in an individual’s appearance.”

As with other plastic surgery procedures, the techniques employed by Dr. Lewis and his staff demand a great deal of skill combined with artistry, and he has helped many patients lose their self-consciousness and gain self-confidence. The results are an aesthetically pleasing nose that complements your face.


## Postprocedure ##

There will most likely be a slight amount of bleeding during the first days of your recuperation, which is completely normal. The area around your nose may also remain stiff for several weeks. There is usually discomfort due to headache and a feeling of stuffiness. Swelling and bruising may occur usually around the eyelids. The bruising is usually gone within seven to 10 days as is a major portion of the swelling.

You will begin to look and feel better within one or two weeks after your procedure. Avoid exercises and activities that will increase your blood pressure. You will need to pay a little extra attention to protecting your nose when you’re bathing or applying make-up. And if you wear glasses, you will have to be very careful not to rest them on the bridge of your nose until it has healed adequately – usually within a month to a month and a half.
