## THE SCIENTIFIC ART OF DR. ROBERT LEWIS ## 

Plastic surgery is first a medical science, but it also a fine art. Few surgeons embody the best of both disciplines more aptly than Dr. Robert Lewis. Dr. Lewis has the credentials and clinical experience that informed patients want in a surgeon. He also has the artistic skills – the eye, deft touch and appreciation for nuance – that create the difference between good and optimal results. And by the way, Dr. Lewis believes in active listening – in order to better understand his patients concerns and preferences.
